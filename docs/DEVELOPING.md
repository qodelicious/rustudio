# Developing rustudio

## Command-line options

Mostly for automated testing and benchmarking.

```sh
rustudio --screenshot out.png    # draw ~120 frames, save the window, exit
rustudio --self-test out.json    # drive the editor with scripted input, exit
rustudio place.rbxl --bench out.json [--play] [--seconds 10]   # frame times (avg, 1% low, slowest frames)
rustudio --stats place.rbxl      # what's in a place (counts by class)
rustudio --camera X,Y,Z,YAW,PITCH ...   # start the camera somewhere (degrees)
# Play a place and look at it like Studio's 863×675 view: click at 40 s, run
# Luau on the client at 45 s, screenshot (plus FILE.view.png) and Output at 50 s
rustudio place.rbxl --play --window 1148x1072 --click 110,143@40 \
  --luau client probe.luau@45 --screenshot shot.png --shot-after 50 --log out.txt
# Several shots timed from the start of Play: shot-2s.png, shot-10s.png, ...
# (each with .view.png, the viewport alone) and shot.frames.json (frame times)
rustudio place.rbxl --play --from-play --shots 2,5,10,20,40 --screenshot shot.png
# A fractional time keeps its decimals (--shots 2.5 -> shot-2.5s.png, 6 or 6.0
# -> shot-6s.png); every file written is printed as "[shot] /abs/path.png" on
# stdout and at the end of the --log file.
# Click a TextBox, type into it, press Enter; turn the wheel at a view position
# (over a ScrollingFrame) instead of the centre:
rustudio place.rbxl --play --from-play --shots 5 --screenshot t.png \
  --click 120,95@2 --type "hello"@2.5 --key Enter@3 --wheel -3@4:400,250
rustudio --write-corpus tools/fidelity/corpus   # regenerate the demo / control places
cargo test --workspace           # unit tests (undo/redo, files, Luau runtime, physics, meshes, FBX, GUI, PKCE)
```
`RUSTUDIO_GUI_DEBUG=1` logs GUI clicks and remote calls to Output;
`RUSTUDIO_NO_GUI=1` hides every GUI (to tell GUI from 3D in a picture).

The `--bench` report (round 20) has, besides avg / 1%-low fps and the
section timers per frame (`play_tick`, `p6b_lua`, `gui_walk`, `gui_mesh`,
`ray_parts`, … and `between_frames`, the time outside the frame's own work),
`lua`: the slowest Lua by connection ("Chunk:line Event"), by resumed
thread ("(resume) Chunk:line" where it waits) and by script start, and
`api`: the slowest engine members called from Lua ("call
FindPartOnRayWithIgnoreList", "index Position") with their call counts.
`RUSTUDIO_HITCH=1` prints every Lua resume over 10 ms (with the engine
calls inside one over 300 ms) and every engine call over 5 ms, to find
hitches.

`--screenshot`, `--self-test` and `--bench` run inside a headless gamescope,
so they never open a window on your screen (`RUSTUDIO_VISIBLE_TESTS=1` shows
them). On macOS there is no gamescope: they run in a normal window (keep it
in front: macOS slows down hidden windows). gamescope's own lines (and its Xwayland's and Vulkan WSI layer's) stay
out of the console: rustudio's stdout / stderr come through, gamescope's are
shown only when the run fails. The self-test's last step opens your place
(`RUSTUDIO_PERF_PLACE`, default the Place A build, else og.rbxl, in `src/mech.rs`) read-only,
plays it for 5 s and records the average and 1%-low frame times.

## macOS

Builds with the same `cargo build --release`; the GPU path is Metal.
Differences from Linux, all in `src/platform.rs` and `src/macos.rs`:

- Per-user files: `~/Library/Application Support/rustudio` (config, Studio
  content, layout, recent files, script drafts) and `~/Library/Caches/rustudio`
  (assets, crash reports) instead of `~/.config`, `~/.local/share`,
  `~/.local/state` and `~/.cache`. The `RUSTUDIO_*` overrides work the same.
- An installed `RobloxStudio.app` (in /Applications or ~/Applications) is
  used for Studio's content, so nothing is downloaded.
- The session cookie is kept in the login Keychain; project folders' deleted
  files go to the Finder Trash (Put Back works).
- Shortcuts are Studio for Mac's: ⌘ where Studio on Windows has Ctrl, ⌥ for
  Alt, and the delete key (Backspace) deletes the selection. Quit (⌘Q) asks
  about unsaved changes like the window's close button.
- Files open from Finder (double-click, Open With, dropping on the Dock icon)
  when rustudio runs as an app.
- Video needs Homebrew's libvpx (`brew install libvpx opus`), found in
  /opt/homebrew/lib or /usr/local/lib.
- Gamepads aren't read yet (Linux reads /dev/input).

`tools/macos/bundle.sh [--universal]` builds `target/macos/rustudio.app` and
a zip of it (ad-hoc signed, not notarized); CI builds the universal one.

## Layout of the code
