**A native Linux and macOS Roblox Studio, written in Rust.** Open, edit and save
Roblox places, press Play and run them with real Luau, physics, characters
and GUIs, without Wine.

Rustudio is very much a beta/prototype, I wouldn't call it a studio replacement
quite yet.

> This project is still early, so please please help!! Contributions are super welcome

## Features

- **Editor:** Explorer, Properties, Output, script tabs, move/scale/rotate
  tools, terrain tools, undo/redo, and Studio's menus, ribbon and shortcuts.
- **Files:** `.rbxl` / `.rbxlx` places and `.rbxm` / `.rbxmx` models, plus
  project folders (`*.project.json` with plain files as the source of truth,
  Rojo/Argon sync rules, `sourcemap.json`, and File > Save as Project
  Folder… to turn any place into one).
- **Play / Run:** separate server and client, remotes, physics (rapier3d),
  R15/R6 characters and animation, sounds, tweens, 2D and 3D GUIs.
- **Luau:** the real Luau VM, with most of the engine API that real games
  call (see [docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md](docs/ENGINE-GAPS.md) for what's missing).
- **Rendering:** wgpu, with lighting, shadows, sky, atmosphere and materials
  tuned against Studio. Meshes, FBX import and terrain are supported.
- **Roblox account:** open your places, load assets and avatars, use
  DataStores, and join Team Create sessions.

## Install

You need a Rust toolchain (1.85+) and a GPU with Vulkan (or OpenGL) on
Linux, or any Mac on macOS 11 or later (Metal).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rippelz/rustudio
cd rustudio
cargo build --release
./target/release/rustudio --demo           # sample scene
./target/release/rustudio my_place.rbxl    # open a place
```

On first launch rustudio downloads Roblox Studio's built-in content
(default characters, camera and control scripts, fonts, textures, sounds;
about 60 MB) from Roblox's own CDN into `~/.local/share/rustudio/studio`
(macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/rustudio/studio`; a Mac with Roblox
Studio installed uses that instead and downloads nothing).
To get it ahead of time, or update it, run
`rustudio --install-studio-content`.

If you already have Studio installed (e.g. via
[Vinegar](https://vinegarhq.org)), you can point rustudio at that instead:

```sh
export RUSTUDIO_STUDIO_DIR=~/.var/app/org.vinegarhq.Vinegar/data/vinegar/versions/version-XXXX
```

### macOS

Download `rustudio-…-macos-universal.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/rippelz/rustudio/releases) (Apple Silicon and
Intel), unzip it and move `rustudio.app` to Applications. The app isn't
notarized by Apple, so the first time right-click it and choose **Open**
(or allow it under System Settings > Privacy & Security). After that it opens
normally, and `.rbxl` / `.rbxm` files can be opened with it from Finder.

To build the app yourself: `tools/macos/bundle.sh` (or `--universal`). Video
playback needs `brew install libvpx opus`. More in
[docs/DEVELOPING.md](docs/DEVELOPING.md#macos).

## Platforms

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 (Wayland or X11) | Supported |
| Linux ARM64 | Should build; untested |
| macOS 11+ (Apple Silicon and Intel) | Supported (beta); tested on Apple Silicon |
| Windows | Not supported yet (doesn't compile: uses Unix-only APIs) |

## Signing in

Everything above works signed out. To open your own places or load private
assets, sign in with your Roblox session: use the account button at the top
right, or put the `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie in `~/.config/rustudio/roblox-cookie`
(macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/rustudio/roblox-cookie`; `chmod 600`).
rustudio stores it in your login keyring (macOS: the Keychain). Details are in
[docs/AUTH.md](docs/AUTH.md).
